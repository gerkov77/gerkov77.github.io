In the first wave of the pandemic I came accross a site called [DataCamp][datacamp]. They offered a
huge discount on online data science courses mainly focusing on matplotlib and pandas framework. I like to spend my free time actively, so as I had some basic knowledge of Python already I went on buying their tutorial.
