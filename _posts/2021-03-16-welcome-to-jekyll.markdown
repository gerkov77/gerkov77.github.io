&nbsp;Finally I have decided to make a website for myself. I started this project mainly due to my love of learning new technologies. I started coding as a hobby in Swift, and Apple's [teaching material][apple] immediately made me fall in love with it. Their coding playgrounds and iOS programming tutorials are clever, funny, interesting, and challenging at the same time. It is really teaching at it's best. As I coded more, I started immersing myself in other technologies too, and started thinking that I need a website, but I shoud build it myself.   
&nbsp; Eventually my friend [Mátyás Budavári][mátyás] told me about [Jekyll][jekyll], an open-source static site generator, and how much fun to use it for pulling up a website. After installing Jekyll, it basically takes a 3 word command to start with a new template project. {% highlight zsh %} $ jekyll new projectname {% endhighlight %} and another 4 word command to  run the server on the local machine. {% highlight zsh %} $ exec bundle jekyll serve {% endhighlight %}Here in the autogenerated configuration files I encountered [YAML][yaml], which is a human-readable data-serialization language. It uses a minimalist syntax like the following: {% highlight YAML %} 
             defaults:
               - scope:
                 path: "assets/img"
                   values:
                     image: true 
                {% endhighlight %}
I immediately fell in love with it, and started looking for a UI theme best fitting my needs. And actually this was the hardest part - took me two days. That is how I found 'Minimal Mistakes'. This is basically a theme for Jekyll, but actually much more than just a theme. It is like a whole sub - framework in my opinion. Here you can basicaly customise your whole site using yaml configuraitions, and you do not even have to touch html. You can check out 'Minimal Mistakes' [here][mistakes].
